# Reproduction Steps

This document describes the steps required to reproduce the experiments
presented in the GlobalAmBC-DRL paper.

The experimental evaluation is fully based on data generated by OMNeT++
simulations and does not rely on external datasets.

---

## 1. Simulation Environment Setup

1. Install OMNeT++ (version 6.0 or later).
2. Configure the INET framework.
3. Import and compile the simulation project located in the `omnetpp/` directory.

---

## 2. Running the Simulation Scenarios

Two simulation scenarios are provided:

- **Baseline scenario** (without adaptive control)
- **DRL-enabled scenario** (with GlobalAmBC-DRL control module enabled)

Run the simulations using the corresponding configuration files:

1. Run the baseline simulation using `baseline.ini`.
2. Run the DRL-enabled simulation using `drl_enabled.ini`.

Each simulation execution will generate output files in OMNeT++ format
(e.g., `.sca` scalar files).

## 3. Metric Collection and Processing

After running the simulations, navigate to the `scripts/` directory and
execute the following steps.

### 3.1 Extract scalar metrics

```bash
python collect_metrics.py baseline.sca
python collect_metrics.py drl.sca
